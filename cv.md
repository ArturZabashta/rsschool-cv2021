###About Me
I'm 36 years old. I worked as a mechanic in a state enterprise, 
but over time I began to realize that this job wasn`t what I wanted to achieve in life. 
I have always been attracted to computer technology. Therefore, 
I decided to change the field of activity and chose front-end development. 
I started learning programming languages on my own from free sources.
When I found out about the opportunity to study at RS-School, I realized that this was my chance.
I hope that together with RS-School I will be able to achieve my goal and become an IT specialist.
